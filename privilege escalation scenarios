privilege escalation scenarios


1. **Sudo Privileges:** Check which commands the current user can run as sudo using the command `sudo -l`.

2. **Misconfigured SUID and SGID Files:** Find all SUID files using `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null` and all SGID files using `find / -perm -g=s -type f 2>/dev/null`.

3. **Kernel Exploits:** Keep the kernel up-to-date and use tools like Lynis for more thorough checks.

4. **Weak File Permissions:** Find world-writable files using `find / -type f -perm -2 ! -user root -ls 2>/dev/null`.

5. **Software Bugs:** Keep all software updated and run with the least privileges necessary. Use vulnerability scanners like Nessus, OpenVAS, or Nikto.

6. **Unsecured Service Configurations:** Check configurations for all running services to ensure they don't grant excessive permissions or expose sensitive information.

7. **Cron Jobs:** Look at all cron jobs (which can typically be found in /etc/crontab or /etc/cron.* directories) for any that run scripts or executables with weak permissions.

8. **Poorly Secured PATH Variables:** Check the PATH for all users, especially privileged users, to ensure there are no writable directories before important system directories. The command `echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n'` will list the directories in the PATH.

9. **Buffer Overflows:** Keep all software up-to-date and consider using security features like address space layout randomization (ASLR) that can help mitigate the impact of buffer overflows.

10. **Race Conditions:** This is harder to test for, but be wary of high-privilege processes that depend on the timing of other processes.

11. **Service Exploits:** Keep all services up-to-date and disable unnecessary ones. Use vulnerability scanners to check for known vulnerabilities in your services.

12. **Unintentional Exposure of Credentials:** Regularly audit your system for exposed credentials. Be careful with commands like `ps` that might expose command-line arguments, and avoid hard-coding passwords or keys in your scripts or programs.

13. **Docker Misconfigurations:** If Docker is used, understand the security implications. Be wary of adding users to the docker group, as this gives them the potential to gain root access.

These are just a few potential scenarios and ways to test for them. Remember that security is a continual process, not a one-time task. Regularly audit your system, apply patches and updates, and use intrusion detection and prevention systems. Conduct penetration testing (with appropriate permission) to find and fix vulnerabilities. And as always, adhere to ethical guidelines and legal requirements when conducting any kind of security testing.
