# Add more checks as needed...
#This script includes checks for sudo permissions, SUID/SGID files, world-writable files, PATH issues, running processes, and NFS shares. However, this script doesn't include checks for software bugs, service exploits, buffer overflows, race conditions, LD_PRELOAD exploits, or Docker misconfigurations.

#Also, it doesn't include any remediation or detailed explanation of the results, and some of the checks could potentially be disruptive or could reveal sensitive information. This script is a starting point, and a full security auditing solution would be significantly more complex.
